# NN Chess Engine

This project is currently in development and aims to build a chess engine using neural networks that can play with human-like behavior rather than typical bot patterns. The goal is to create an engine that makes the game feel more natural and engaging, as if you're playing against a real human opponent rather than a mechanical computer program. By incorporating neural network techniques, I hope to achieve more intuitive and varied gameplay that mirrors human decision-making processes and playing styles.
